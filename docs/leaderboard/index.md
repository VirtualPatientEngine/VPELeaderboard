Below is a **mock leaderboard table** illustrating how algorithm performance will be structured and compared:

| Rank | **Algorithm Name** | Task/Data | Metric 1 | Metric 2 | Metric 3 | ... |
|------|------------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-----|
| 🥇 1  | Algo 1           | Task A    | 0.92    | 0.85    | 0.78    | ... |
| 🥈 2  | Algo 2           | Task A    | 0.90    | 0.80    | 0.75    | ... |
| 🥉 3  | Algo 3           | Task B    | 0.88    | 0.78    | 0.72    | ... |

Each **row** represents a different **algorithm** ranked by performance. Each **column** represents different **evaluation metrics**
